We took very low-light images of clouds at night from a cellphone, this is an
attempt to recover *something* from those images.

Really all that's happening is a plotting of the raw values scaled to a color
scale that's not just black, black, and slightly less black... Turns out, still
can't see anything :(

```{r read-img, }
for (filename in list.files(pattern = "*.jpg")) {
    img <- filename %>%
        readJPEG() %>% 
        melt() %>% 
        as_tibble() %>% 
        rename(x = Var1,
               y = Var2,
               col = Var3)
    
    img %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = x,
                   y = y,
                   fill = col)) +
        geom_raster() +
        facet_wrap(~ col)
}
```
